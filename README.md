"Oh-ho-ho, I adore Rock Paper Scissors! Although, where I've come from, we call it 'Quartz Parchment Shears.'" - Pops

Rock Paper Scissors is the game that we all know and love. Its rules are simple, easy to play, and require two players. This repository contains the code for this same game written with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. Instead of two human players playing against each other, the game is played with the user and a computer. The web app will track the number of wins, losses, and ties for each player and save them to local storage. It also features the ability for the user to clear the scores and start over. The name and font of the game are inspired by the "Regular Show" episode called "First Day," in which the two protoganists play Rock Paper Scissors to decide who gets an old couch. The background image of this web app is also from Regular Show.

## Features

- **Regular-Show Inspired Styles**: The font for the title and background image is inspired by what is used in the Regular Show's title card that appears at the beginning of every episode.
- **Score Tracking**: The number of wins, losses, and ties for each player is tracked and saved to local storage.
- **Responsive Design**: The web app is responsive and will adjust to any screen size, up to the smallest smartphones.
- **Clear Scores**: The user can clear the scores and start over.
